## Beyond the Medal: Women in the Olympics

Gender discrimination in sports has been a long-standing issue, with male and female athletes receiving unequal chances and recognition across disciplines. Despite significant progress in many areas of society, gender disparities persist in sports, both in terms of participation and representation. This research seeks to investigate the amount of gender discrimination in the participation of male and female athletes in certain sports and nations, with an emphasis on detecting trends that show gender equality or inequality.

The goal of this study is to examine at gender representation across different sports at the national level by comparing the participation of male and female athletes. The study will determine if various sports display gender equality or discrimination by thoroughly examining a dataset that contains sex, nation, and sport category statistics. The study will be conducted using the male-to-female athlete ratio, offering a quantitative way to assessing inequalities or progress toward equal representation.

## Research Question and Aim

What extent is gender discrimination in the participation of male and female athletes in particular sports and nations, and what are the trends of equal representation in various sports?

The purpose of this study is to examine gender representation in athlete involvement across many sports in order to discover trends of gender equality or discrimination at the national level. Using a dataset that includes sex, nation, and sport category, the study will determine whether sports are gender-equal or gender-unequal based on the male-to-female athlete ratio. Inequality can be detected using classification approaches, with visualizations offering further information. A bar chart can provide male-to-female participation rates for each sport type, color-coded by equality status, whereas a heatmap can show the severity of gender discrepancies among nations and sports. Furthermore, a pie chart can show the overall proportion of gender-equal vs gender-unequal sports, providing a clear picture of worldwide trends. This analysis will ensure that findings regarding gender discrimination in sports participation are accessible.
