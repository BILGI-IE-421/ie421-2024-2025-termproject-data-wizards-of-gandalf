## Beyond the Medal: Women in the Olympics

Women's Olympic journeys have been made a distinction by decades of struggle, marginalization, and, finally, empowerment. Female athletes' involvement in the Olympic Games has historically been influenced by wider socioeconomic issues such as economic growth, political systems, and cultural views toward gender equality. Understanding the factors influencing female athlete engagement is critical to fostering gender equality in sports. This research will examine three interrelated questions: Initially, this research will investigate the influence of political and economic determinants specifically the Democracy Index, Gender Inequality Index (GII), and GDP per capita on the representation of female athletes in the forthcoming Paris 2024 Olympics. Through a thorough examination of these variables, the investigation aims to explanaiton the way social structures determine the opportunities provided to women in sports. Second, this study will examine the correlation between gender equity in sports participation across various Olympic disciplines and the Gender Inequality Index (GII) of the respective nations, aiming to ascertain which sports demonstrate greater inclusivity and whether societal gender equality corresponds to enhanced participation equity in athletic endeavors. Finally, this study will examine the patterns in the number of female athletes sent to the Olympics throughout time and how these changes correspond to the nations' economic progress, as defined by GDP. The purpose is to determine how economic growth affects the progress of female athlete representation and if nations with greater GDP are more effective in obtaining gender equality in sport. All of these questions will provide vital insights into the present struggle for gender equality in worldwide sports.

## Research Question and Aim

What extent is gender discrimination in the participation of male and female athletes in particular sports and nations, and what are the trends of equal representation in various sports?

The purpose of this study is to examine gender representation in athlete involvement across many sports in order to discover trends of gender equality or discrimination at the national level. Using a dataset that includes sex, nation, and sport category, the study will determine whether sports are gender-equal or gender-unequal based on the male-to-female athlete ratio. Inequality can be detected using classification approaches, with visualizations offering further information. A bar chart can provide male-to-female participation rates for each sport type, color-coded by equality status, whereas a heatmap can show the severity of gender discrepancies among nations and sports. Furthermore, a pie chart can show the overall proportion of gender-equal vs gender-unequal sports, providing a clear picture of worldwide trends. This analysis will ensure that findings regarding gender discrimination in sports participation are accessible.
