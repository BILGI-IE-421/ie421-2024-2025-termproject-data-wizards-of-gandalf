## Beyond the Medal: The Economical, Social and Cultural Impact of Women in the Olympics

Women's Olympic journeys have been made a distinction by decades of struggle, marginalization, and, finally, empowerment. Female athletes' involvement in the Olympic Games has historically been influenced by wider socioeconomic issues such as economic growth, political systems, and cultural views toward gender equality. Understanding the factors influencing female athlete engagement is critical to fostering gender equality in sports. This research will examine three interrelated questions: Initially, this research will investigate the influence of political and economic determinants specifically the Democracy Index, Gender Inequality Index (GII), and GDP per capita on the representation of female athletes in the forthcoming Paris 2024 Olympics. Through a thorough examination of these variables, the investigation aims to explanaiton the way social structures determine the opportunities provided to women in sports. Second, this study will examine the correlation between gender equity in sports participation across various Olympic disciplines and the Gender Inequality Index (GII) of the respective nations, aiming to ascertain which sports demonstrate greater inclusivity and whether societal gender equality corresponds to enhanced participation equity in athletic endeavors. Finally, this study will examine the patterns in the number of female athletes sent to the Olympics throughout time and how these changes correspond to the nations' economic progress, as defined by GDP. The purpose is to determine how economic growth affects the progress of female athlete representation and if nations with greater GDP are more effective in obtaining gender equality in sport. All of these questions will provide vital insights into the present struggle for gender equality in worldwide sports.

## Research Questions and Their Aims
Q1) What is the impact of the Democracy Index, Gender Inequality Index (GII), and GDP per capita on the proportion of female athletes in Olympic teams for Paris 2024, and are there discernible trends across continents or income categories?

This question explores the interactions among social, political, and economic elements and how they influence gender balance in sports, especially considering the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. The study aims to determine how these systemic institutions affect the percentage of female athletes on national Olympic teams by looking at the GDP per capita, the Gender Inequality Index (GII), and the Democracy Index as explanatory factors. To find trends the study will involve several analytical techniques. Data visualization tools will make it easier to see patterns in the correlation between the ratio of female athletes in various nations and some aspects like economic, political, and social. How strongly these elements are related by utilizing correlation analysis to analyze the direction and degree of correlations between variables such as the Democracy Index, GII, GDP per capita, and female athlete involvement will be understood. Moreover, group comparisons will assist in identifying notable differences in the contribution of female athletes across continents or economic brackets, offering additional understanding of worldwide trends in gender.

Q2) What extent is gender discrimination in the participation of male and female athletes in particular sports and nations, and what are the trends of equal representation in various sports?

The purpose of this study is to examine gender representation in athlete involvement across many sports in order to discover trends of gender equality or discrimination at the national level. Using a dataset that includes sex, nation, and sport category, the study will determine whether sports are gender-equal or gender-unequal based on the male-to-female athlete ratio. Inequality can be detected using classification approaches, with visualizations offering further information. A bar chart can provide male-to-female participation rates for each sport type, color-coded by equality status, whereas a heatmap can show the severity of gender discrepancies among nations and sports. Furthermore, a pie chart can show the overall proportion of gender-equal vs gender-unequal sports, providing a clear picture of worldwide trends. This analysis will ensure that findings regarding gender discrimination in sports participation are accessible.

Q3) How does the number of female athletes that nations have sent to the Olympics over time relate to GDP growth? What does the difference in trends between income groups tell us about how economic development contributes to the advancement of gender equality in sports?

This question examines the relationship between gender equality, economic development and women's participation in sport by examining differences in the number of female athletes submitted by countries, as well as their relationship with GDP growth and the Gender Inequality Index (GII). A variety of data visualization techniques can be used to properly show these patterns. With income groups or areas separated by size or color, a scatter plot can show the correlation between GDP development and the proportion of female athletes across time. Line graphs can highlight longitudinal changes in female athlete participation by showing patterns across socioeconomic levels. The percentage of male and female athletes in different sports for different nations or areas can be compared using a stacked bar chart. As a result, a bubble chart combining data on women's participation, GDP and GII can show the relationship between gender differences in sport and gender inequality at the societal level. These methods allow for a more complex understanding of the relationship between gender equality, economic growth and participation in sport.
